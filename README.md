 Task Done
The provided R code performs data analysis and visualization tasks on a dataset. Key steps include:

1. Data Cleaning and Preparation:
    Removing unwanted columns and rows with missing values.
    Renaming columns for better accessibility.
    Converting data types for consistency.

2. Descriptive Statistics:
    Summarizing the dataset with statistical measures (e.g., mean, median).
    Exploring groupwise statistics (e.g., genderbased averages).

3. Data Visualization:
    Creating various plots such as bar charts, histograms, boxplots, line plots, pie charts, and scatter plots to analyze trends and relationships.

4. Statistical Tests:
    Performing ttests to compare groups (e.g., male vs. female spending).
    Generating a correlation matrix to study relationships between numerical variables.

5. Modeling:
    Building a linear regression model to predict the relationship between quantity and amount spent.

6. Scaling:
    Standardizing numerical variables for further analysis.

 Outcomes of the Project
 Insights into Customer Behavior: Analysis of age distribution, spending patterns by gender, and sales trends over time.
 Channel Performance: Understanding sales distribution across different channels.
 Category Analysis: Identifying categories with higher average spending.
 Predictive Insights: Regression modeling highlights the relationship between quantity ordered and amount spent.

 Usefulness
This project is useful for businesses aiming to:
 Optimize marketing strategies by understanding customer demographics and behavior.
 Improve inventory management by analyzing sales trends.
 Enhance decisionmaking through statistical tests and predictive modeling.
